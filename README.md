Tell me about yourself
======================

1. It's my pleasure to introduce myself. / Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
2. My name is Arun Kaliyaperumal (or) Myself is Arun Kaliyaperumal
	If the questioner is mentioned your name and asking, Mr.Arun, Can you tell me about yourself, skip the fist step.
3. 	Well. I've been in Java Develpment and Support for last 3 years. 
	3.1 My most recent experiance is in the gift card industry where i am a lead software engineer. 
	
	3.2 I am personally responsible for managing TMS and VTS applications.
	
	3.3 TMS(Transaction Monitoring System) monitors sales activities for all retail locations for which the system is configured. The system monitors both sales volume (dollar amount of transactions) and transaction volume (number of transactions) for a merchant location in real time.
	The Fraud team sets up fraud monitoring rules in TMS that trigger alert notifications when it reaches the threshold. 
	TMS Supports two alert type, WARNING AND SHUTDOWN. When the fraud rule is created with WARNING, when the threshold reached, then email alert will go to Fraud department.
	When the fraud rule is created with SHUTDOWN, failure response code(Suspected Fraud) will be sent it to merchant.
	Rules can be modified or deleted, as required. The Fraud team also has the ability to turn off, or disable, a fraud monitoring rule for a merchant.
	
	3.4 VTS()
	Virtual Terminal System (VTS) is a patented web application that provides the flexibility to sell InComm’s complete line of prepaid products without the need for a physical terminal.
	VTS‘s intuitive design provides a fast and easy-to-use platform. You can easily activate, deactivate or redeem prepaid card-based products, sell virtual products such as PINs, and add money to an existing mobile account. You also can add a valid card swipe reader or scanner, which enables you to swipe or scan select InComm card encoding specifications for quicker, more efficient processing. You can print the confirmation page of a transaction, using a receipt. If terms and conditions are included for the transaction, they appear at the bottom of the confirmation page, and you can print them too.
	
4.	I think my main strength is the leadership ability which was evident the way i mentor team members to get up to the speed of supporting the applications. 
	What i am looking for is the company that values the team work and the group dynamic where i can join the strong team and have a positive impact on the team to acheive the project goals.
